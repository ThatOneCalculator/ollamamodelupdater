# Ollama Model Updater

The Ollama Model Updater will look at all the models you have on your system, check if there is a different version on ollama.ai, and pull the model if there is. Super simple, now with Bun.

You can grab the executable for your platform over on the [releases page](https://github.com/thatonecalculator/ollamamodelupdater-bun/releases)
